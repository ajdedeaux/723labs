# 723 Labs Website Specification

**Domain:** 723labs.io  
**Purpose:** Convert service business owners into discovery calls  
**Primary Action:** Schedule a consultation

---

## Executive Summary

This spec defines a 5-page website that sells the 723 Labs methodology. The site exists to do one thing: get qualified prospects on a discovery call. Everything else supports that goal.

**Key insight from the documents:** Your story is the differentiator. The methodology is proven (Chef G). The pricing makes sense ($6K-$25K vs $45K-$133K). But the "Fresh Out Framework" — building from constraint, learning by doing, no safety net — that's what people remember.

Lead with the story. Prove with the case study. Close with the call.

## Part 2: Page-by-Page Content

---

### PAGE 1: Home (/)

**Purpose:** Hook, build trust, drive to call

**Sections:**

#### Hero Section
- **Headline:** "I Build the Machine So You Can Focus on the Work"
- **Subhead:** "Complete business operating systems for service companies. Not websites — revenue machines that run while you sleep."
- **CTA:** [Book a Discovery Call]
- **Visual:** Dark, minimal. Text-forward. No stock photos. Maybe a subtle grid/tech pattern.

#### The Problem (Pain Agitation)
- **Headline:** "You're Probably Doing This Right Now"
- Bullets:
  - Leads come in through 5 different channels, none of them connected
  - You respond when you can — sometimes same day, sometimes not
  - Your "CRM" is a spreadsheet you haven't opened in weeks
  - Your website looks fine but doesn't convert
  - You know you need a system but don't have time to build one
- **Tagline:** "Great service. No system. That's the gap."

#### The Solution (What I Do)
- **Headline:** "What If Your Business Ran Without You?"
- Three columns:
  - **Capture** — Website that converts, forms that qualify, 24/7 lead capture
  - **Automate** — AI that responds instantly, calendars that sync, payments that collect
  - **Grow** — Marketing strategy based on real data, ads that work, ROI you can measure
- **Line:** "One engagement. Complete system. You own everything."

#### The Proof (Chef G Teaser)
- **Headline:** "Built in 6 Weeks. Paying for Itself in 60 Days."
- Card with key stats:
  - 12+ page custom web application
  - Voice AI that calls leads in under 60 seconds
  - $2,125 average ticket
  - 19% close rate
  - 20x+ projected ROAS
- **CTA:** [See the Full Case Study]

#### The Philosophy (Testing Mindset)
- **Headline:** "Build Fast. Test Relentlessly. Kill What Doesn't Work."
- Short paragraph:
  - "We built a text-based AI assistant. It worked technically. But real-world testing showed it needed more personal touch. We killed it in a week and pivoted to voice AI — which performed significantly better on day one. That's the methodology: every automation is tested against real leads. When something doesn't fit, we find what does. The goal isn't to automate everything — it's to surface where human touch is essential and protect it."
- **Tagline:** "Automation finds the humans. That's the point."

#### The Story Hook (Why Me)
- **Headline:** "I Built This While Working 50+ Hours a Week"
- Short version (2-3 sentences):
  - "In April 2023, I walked out of federal prison after nine years. No network, no resume, no safety net. Within 18 months, I built a complete business operating system for a client — in my off-hours. If I can do that under those constraints, imagine what I can build for you."
- **CTA:** [Read the Full Story]

  | Deliverables | Website, maybe strategy | Complete operating system |
  | AI Included | $10K add-on | Standard |

#### Final CTA

### PAGE 4: About (/about)

**Purpose:** Tell the full story, build trust, show humanity

**Sections:**

#### Hero
- **Headline:** "From Zero to Operating Systems"
- **Subhead:** "The 723 Labs Story"

#### The Origin Story
Full version of the Fresh Out Framework narrative:

> In April 2023, I walked out of federal prison after nine years. No network. No resume. No clue how much the world had changed.
>
> Within 18 months:
> - I became the #1 Sleep Expert in my Mattress Firm district, generating $1.2M+ in annual sales
> - I landed a junior consultant role at Analytics AIML, an AI strategy firm
> - I built a complete business operating system for a catering company — while working a full-time W-2
>
> The Chef G Events project you see in our case study? I built that in my off-hours. Twelve pages, six API integrations, an AI assistant, a marketing strategy based on analyzing 161 real leads, and documentation that rivals what agencies charge $50K to produce.

#### How I Learned

> I didn't go to bootcamp. I didn't hire a coach. I learned by doing.
>
> My uncle Frank Shines — Lean Six Sigma Black Belt, enterprise consultant, the guy Fortune 500 companies call when systems are broken — became my mentor. He taught me to see business as systems. Inputs, outputs, constraints, leverage points.
>
> But the real accelerator was AI. I realized that what took developers weeks, I could build in days. What took marketers months of testing, I could analyze in hours. The constraint of having no formal training became an advantage — I had no "right way" to unlearn. I just used whatever worked.

#### Why 723 Labs

> The name isn't random. 7/23 marks a turning point — a date that changed everything. It's a reminder that transformation happens on specific days, through specific decisions.
>
> 723 Labs exists because I know what it's like to rebuild from zero. Small business owners don't need another agency that charges $50K and takes six months. They need someone who understands constraint. Who builds fast because they have to. Who delivers results because reputation is everything when you're starting over.

#### The Framework

> I transformed my own life using the same methodology I now use for clients:
>
> 1. Identify the outcome
> 2. Map the system
> 3. Leverage AI for the 80% that doesn't need human touch
> 4. Focus human expertise on the 20% that does
> 5. Document everything so the system runs without you
>
> That's the Fresh Out Framework. It's not about where you start. It's about how fast you learn when failure isn't an option.

#### Why Clients Trust Me

> When a client asks "Why should I trust you?" — the answer is simple: Look at what I built. Look at the results. And understand that I built this while working 50+ hours a week at a day job, with no team, no funding, and no safety net.
>
> If I can build this under those constraints, imagine what I can do with your business.

## Part 3: Brand Voice & Tone

### Voice Principles (From Your Documents)

1. **Conversational, not corporate.** Write like you're talking to someone, not at them.
2. **Direct, not salesy.** State what you do clearly. No buzzwords.
3. **Confident, not arrogant.** You've done the work. Let the work speak.
4. **Human, not polished.** Your story is the differentiator. Don't sanitize it.
5. **Authentic over impressive.** "I built this in my off-hours" beats "industry-leading solutions."

### Tone Examples

**Instead of:** "We leverage cutting-edge AI technology to optimize business operations."  
**Write:** "I use AI to build what used to take agencies months. You get a better system, faster, for less."

**Instead of:** "Our team of experts delivers world-class results."  
**Write:** "It's me, a Replit subscription, and a network of specialists I bring in when needed. No overhead. No bloat."

**Instead of:** "Transform your digital presence with our comprehensive solutions."  
**Write:** "I build the machine so you can focus on the work."

### Headlines That Work

- "I Build the Machine So You Can Focus on the Work"
- "Not Just a Website — A Revenue Machine"
- "What If Your Business Ran Without You?"
- "Built in 6 Weeks. Paying for Itself in 60 Days."
- "Same System. 80% Less Cost."

### Headlines to Avoid

- "Innovative Solutions for Modern Businesses"
- "Transforming the Future of Digital"
- "Your Partner in Success"
- Anything with "synergy," "leverage," "disrupt," "revolutionize"

---

## Part 4: Visual Direction

### Color Palette

**Primary:**
- Black (#0a0a0a) — Primary text, backgrounds
- White (#ffffff) — Light backgrounds, reverse text
- Accent Blue/Teal (#0ea5e9 or similar) — CTAs, links, highlights

**Secondary:**
- Slate Gray (#64748b) — Secondary text
- Light Gray (#f1f5f9) — Section backgrounds, cards

**Philosophy:** Dark, minimal, technical but approachable. Not flashy. Not corporate. Clean.

### Typography

**Headings:** Inter or similar clean sans-serif (bold/semibold)
**Body:** Same family, regular weight
**Alternative:** System fonts for speed

### Design Elements

- **No stock photos** — Text-forward, maybe subtle geometric patterns
- **Cards** — Rounded corners, subtle shadows, clean borders
- **Spacing** — Generous whitespace, let the content breathe
- **Icons** — Lucide or similar, simple line icons only
- **Animations** — Subtle. Fade-ins on scroll. Nothing flashy.

### Imagery

- Screenshot/mockup of Chef G site (if appropriate)
- Simple diagrams for process visualization
- No headshots unless you want one on About page
- No team photos (you work lean)

---

## Part 5: Technical Build Approach

### Stack Recommendation

**Option A: Fresh Replit (Fastest)**
- Clone the Chef G stack: React + TypeScript + Express + Tailwind + Shadcn
- 5 pages, simple routing with Wouter
- Contact form submits to Sheets or sends email
- Calendly embed for scheduling
- No database needed (static content site)

**Option B: Simple Static**
- Could even be simpler: React + Tailwind only
- No backend needed
- Vercel/Netlify for hosting

**My Recommendation:** Option A in a fresh Replit. You already know the stack. Can be built in a day.

### Pages to Build

| Page | Complexity | Priority |
|------|------------|----------|
| Home | Medium (multiple sections) | 1 |
| Case Study | Medium (data display) | 2 |
| Services | Simple (cards grid) | 3 |
| About | Simple (text-heavy) | 4 |
| Contact | Simple (form + Calendly) | 5 |

### Integrations Needed

- **Calendly** — Embed or link for discovery call booking
- **Email** — Contact form submissions (can use existing Google Apps Script pattern)
- **Analytics** — Google Analytics or Plausible for tracking
- **Domain** — Point 723labs.io to Replit deployment

### Estimated Build Time

If using familiar stack: **1-2 days for MVP**

- Day 1: Home page + Navigation + Footer + Contact form
- Day 2: Case Study + Services + About + Polish

---

## Part 6: Assets Needed From You

### Must Have

| Asset | Purpose | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|

### Nice to Have

| Asset | Purpose | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|

| **Logo File** | Header branding | Can be text-only "723 Labs" |
| **Chef G Screenshots** | Case study visuals | I can generate these from the live site |
| **Testimonial from Granison** | Case study + Home | Actual quote to replace placeholder |
