**How premium dark sites stay readable:**

1. **Don’t use pure black (#000) + pure white (#FFF)** — Too harsh, causes eye strain. Use off-black (#0A0A0A or #111) and off-white (#E5E5E5 or #F5F5F5)
1. **Text hierarchy with gray tones** — Headlines in white, body copy in a softer gray (#A1A1A1), labels in muted gray (#6B6B6B)
1. **Generous line-height** — 1.5-1.7 for body text
1. **Subtle text glow** — Some premium sites add a faint glow behind white text to lift it off the background

**Your current palette:**

From what I see, you’re running **monochromatic** — black, white, zinc grays. No accent color yet.

**Options for an accent:**

|Color                     |Vibe                                   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|
|Electric blue (#3B82F6)   |Tech, trustworthy, Linear/Vercel energy|
|Warm white/cream (#FAF9F6)|Subtle, premium, Apple-esque           |
|Muted gold (#C9A227)      |Luxury, pairs with your Chef G work    |
|Soft green (#10B981)      |Growth, success, money                 |

I’d lean toward **electric blue** or **muted gold** as a subtle accent for hover states, links, or key highlights — not splashed everywhere, just strategic pops.

**Prompt for Replit:**

> Two fixes needed:
> 
> **1. Readability:**
> 
> - Soften the contrast — don’t use pure #000 and #FFF together
> - Use off-black (#0A0A0A or #111) for backgrounds
> - Use off-white (#E5E5E5) for body text, keep headlines brighter
> - Increase line-height on body copy to 1.6
> 
> **2. Animation:**
> 
> - The scroll animation on the pain points section is too slow and laggy — it feels cheap
> - Either make it instant (0.1s-0.2s fade-up) or remove it entirely
> - Speed > smoothness. If it can’t be fast, kill it.
> 
> **Optional:** Consider adding a subtle accent color (electric blue #3B82F6 or muted gold #C9A227) for hover states and links only — not everywhere, just strategic touches.
