I need you to step into a different mode. Forget "functional." Forget "MVP."
You are now a $50K brand designer and UX specialist. The kind of person who builds sites for venture-backed startups, luxury brands, and people who don't ask "how much" — they ask "how good."
The Brief:
The current 723 Labs site is functional. It works. But it's flat. It doesn't make someone feel something when they land on it. I need this site to hit different.
Who I Am:
I came from the slums. Nine years in federal prison. No network, no resume, no safety net. I built my way out through pure execution. I'm a diamond in the rough — raw, real, but polished where it counts. I dress sharp. I speak with precision. I deliver. The site needs to reflect that energy.
The Aesthetic I Want:

Premium but grounded — Not flashy-rich. Quiet confidence. The difference between a guy in a loud Gucci logo shirt vs. a guy in a perfectly tailored black tee.
Dark, sophisticated, intentional — Every pixel should feel considered. Nothing accidental.
Movement that feels alive — Subtle animations, smooth transitions, micro-interactions that make the page feel responsive and premium. Not gimmicky — purposeful.
Typography that commands — Headlines should hit. Body text should breathe. Hierarchy should be crystal clear.
Whitespace as a power move — Let the content breathe. Premium brands don't crowd.
Details that reward attention — Hover states, scroll reveals, subtle gradients, refined shadows. The stuff that makes designers nod.

Reference Energy (not to copy, but to feel):

Linear.app — Clean, dark, every interaction feels premium
Stripe.com — Sophisticated gradients, beautiful typography, animations that feel effortless
Vercel.com — Developer-focused but stunning, dark mode done right
Apple.com — The confidence to let product speak, whitespace as design
Rolls Royce / Porsche sites — Luxury without trying too hard

What to Elevate:

Hero section — Make it cinematic. The headline should feel like it's carved in stone. Add depth — maybe a subtle gradient, a refined glow, or a motion element that draws the eye.
Typography upgrade — If Space Grotesk isn't hitting premium enough, explore: Söhne, Satoshi, General Sans, or keep it but refine the weights and spacing.
Card components — Add subtle glass morphism, refined borders, hover states that feel tactile. When someone hovers on a service package, it should feel like picking up a luxury brochure.
Scroll experience — Elements should reveal with intention. Fade-ups, subtle parallax, staggered animations. Not overwhelming — choreographed.
The Numbers/Comparison section — Make this feel like a data visualization from a premium deck. Not just a table — something that visually communicates the value gap.
CTA buttons — These should feel like they want to be clicked. Subtle glow, smooth hover transitions, maybe a slight scale or shadow shift.
Footer — Even the footer should feel finished. Not an afterthought.

What to Keep:

The copy is solid. Don't change the words.
The dark aesthetic is right. Go darker if anything.
The story is the differentiator. Make sure it still lands.
Mobile must be flawless. Premium doesn't break on iPhone.

The Test:
When someone lands on this site, I want them to think: "Damn. This person is serious." Not "nice website" — I want respect. I want them to feel like they're about to talk to someone who operates at a different level.
Rebuild the front-end with this energy. Show me what $50K execution looks like.
